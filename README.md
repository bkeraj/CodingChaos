Project : Dental Clinic System

 Automatization and the decrement of the human intervention is basically the main course all businesses are following to succeed in an environment where the customer satisfaction is crucial. This model businesses are following provides fast service,transparency, easy access by the customers and as a result more successful business and more loyal clients who are satifyied with your service.
 
 A system for a dental clinic is what we are trying to establish. Having a system to organize all the services and customers help the clinic to easier manage the operations,schedules,keep track of the patients cards etc.
 Every one who wants to receive a service from this denatal clinic can book his appointment and the type of service needed, based on the available schedules. Another user of the system is the service providers,dentists. They can have their profile where are stored all the patients' cards under their supervision. And the third user is the admin(recepsionist) who will add or delete dentists' , patients account keep track of the schedules and notify the patients in case of any change to the schedule or other operations.
